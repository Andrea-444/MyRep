        <h2>Get to know me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Andrea Stevanoska and I want to share with you a glimpse into my life - a life fueled with love for animals, a passion for computer science, a hunger for exploration, and an unbreakable bond with my family. Join me on this journey as we dive deep into my experiences that have shaped who I am today. Since I was young, I have been in awe of the incredible world of animals. I have a special place in my heart for dogs and cats and all kinds of animals. My mischievous cat, Masha, and my dog, Bobby, have simply become members of my family.
            <br></br>I'm a first year student at Faculty of Informatics and Computer Engineering and I study Computer science. I quickly became fascinated by the endless possibilities and the power of technology. With each line of code I wrote, I got closer and closer to my goals. Among all this, I am always open for new experiences like travelling and meeting new people. Travelling became my gateway to fulfilling my dreams. Through travelling, I met some wonderful people and I built countless friendships.</p>

                    <h3>Kotor, Montenegro</h3>
                    <p>I've visited almost every corner of Montenegro, but my favourite places there are: Ostrog, Petrovac and Kotor. This picture is taken in Kotor.</p>

                    <p>These past few years, Greece has been my go-to vacation spot. Here are some greek cats - a small part of the beautiful island of Corfu.</p>

                    <p>I recently went to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, for New Year's, but I must say it won me over with its beauty and liveliness. Just take a look at the sky (I swear It's not edited!).</p>

                    <p>Turkey is one of the countries that I never get tired of. Especially Istanbul. Besides Istanbul, I've also visited Antalya and I totally fell in love with the place.</p>

    <h2>Erasmus +</h2>
    <p>My favourite project so far has been the one in Istanbul, Turkey. The culture, the city, the
        friendliness of the people etc. All of it was simply amazing. I met some wonderful people
        from different cultures, with different traditions. We were accommodated in Silivri, which is close to Istanbul, but
        it is a whole other city. The city was a dream, it was peaceful enough and full of opportunities for young people
        like us to have fun. The one thing I didn't like that much was the food,
        but it was probably because of it being at a new place and completely new kind of food. I needed time to adjust.
        After all people are adjustable creatures.
        Here you can get to see Silivri and Istanbul through my eyes and maybe even better!</p>
